            <h2>Understanding Basic Network Security</h2>
            <p>
                Network security is the foundation of modern cybersecurity. 
                It focuses on protecting communication channels, preventing unauthorized access, 
                and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. 
                Learning concepts like firewalls, VLANs, and secure protocols is essential 
                for every cybersecurity student.

            <h2>Why Linux Is Important in Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>
                Linux is one of the most essential tools for cybersecurity professionals. 
                Its open-source structure allows deep system control, making it ideal for penetration 
                testing, digital forensics, and server security. Tools like Nmap, Metasploit, 
                and Wireshark work more efficiently on Linux-based systems.

            <h2>Introduction to Ethical Hacking</h2>
            <p>
                Ethical hacking involves legally testing systems for vulnerabilities before attackers 
                exploit them. It includes scanning, enumeration, exploitation, and reporting. 
                Ethical hackers follow strict rules and aim to improve an organization's security 
                posture by helping them fix weaknesses.
